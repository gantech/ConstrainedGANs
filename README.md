# Physics Constrained GANs

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and example cases for the following paper:

Y. Zeng, J.L. Wu, and H. Xiao. Enforcing Deterministic Constraints on Generative Adversarial Networks for Emulating Physical Systems. Submitted, 2019.

Developed by Yang Zeng at https://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty/xiaoheng/personal-page.html[Dr. Heng Xiao's Data Enabled Computational Mechanics group] at Virginia Tech . Our implementation is built upon the standard, baseline  https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models [GANs implementation] by Kristiadi et al.

## Requires
1. Python 3.X
2. Tensorflow 1.12.0
3. Numpy 
4. Scipy

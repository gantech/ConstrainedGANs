# ConstrainedGANs

#### Introduction
This is the code and example cases for the following paper:

Y. Zeng, J.L. Wu, and H. Xiao. Enforcing Deterministic Constraints on Generative Adversarial Networks for Emulating Physical Systems. Submitted.

Developed by Yang Zeng at Dr. Heng Xiao's group at Virginia Tech (https://www.aoe.vt.edu/people/faculty/xiaoheng/personal-page.html). Our implementation is built upon the standard, baseline GANs implementation by Kristiadi et al. (https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models).

#### Requires
1. Python 3.X
2. Tensorflow 1.12.0
3. Numpy 
4. Scipy
